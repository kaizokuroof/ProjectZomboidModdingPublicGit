# ProjectZomboidModdingPublicGit
Just some random things

Setup:
1) Make a new folder with whatever name. I use 'RandoBuildings'. Include the drive letter and rest of the path.
2) Copy the building TMX file (template) into that folder

How to use?

1) update the $directory variable to a folder
2) run the script

This does not work with existing buildings. If you want to make random buildings, open the template file I supplied and delete everything, make the new building and save it.
Copy that building to the rando buildings.
Run the scirpt and it should generate 10 buildings with different roofs and such.
Does not work with 'tile' objects.

Happy moddings frens!
